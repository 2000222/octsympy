OctSymPy for Matlab
===================

README.md is the main document.  Here we list any Matlab-specific notes.

Formatting: Matlab uses a different formatting for comment headers.
Most of the .m files have been autoconverted from the GNU Octave
versions.

Tests: Many .m files have tests built-in following the function using
Octave's test framework.  Some effort to run these on Matlab?  But it
would be a good idea.
