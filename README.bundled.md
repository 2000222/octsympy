Windows Package Bundled Software
================================

To avoid dependencies, the experimental Windows package includes
bundled third-party binaries and source.


Single-File Stand-alone Python 2.7.8 for Windows

available from:

License: doesn't have a formal license, but something like public domain, see README.

Here are two parts of the README file:

>  I have often wanted a stand-alone version of python that would be a single
>  Windows executable.  This is my attempt to make a generally useful executable.
>
>  It consists of Python 2.7.8, plus pywin32-219, and includes all packages that
>  py2exe sensibly includes without extra work.


>  Go ahead and use the executable or source as you see fit.  Credit is
>  appreciated, but not necessary.  I accept no liability.
>
>  If you found this useful, let me know.  If there is an issue, also let me know.
>  Obviously, one could include more or less libraries to either add features or
>  reduce the size of the executable.  I don't intend to make alternate versions
>  with different libraries.
