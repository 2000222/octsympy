IPC experiments
===============

1) temp file works on windows w/ py.exe and python.org win install

2) system doesn't work on either, perhaps cmd.exe multiline
   todo write test for this, even just with sort?

3) popen2 works in principle on windows
   a. python install works w/ tests (but not octsympy yet?)
   b. py.exe has bug with pipes, reported
