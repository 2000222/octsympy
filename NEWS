octsympy 0.1.1 (yyyy-mm-dd)
===========================

 *  New commands:

          and
          char
          diag
          eig
          isscalar
          isvector
          or
          uplus
          xor

 *  IPC system() should work on windows (FIXME: test header load)

 *  Improvements to logical and isAlways commands.

 *  Improvements to internel string handling/escaping especially newlines.

     -  Enter a multiline command using a cell array of lines e.g.,
        `python_cmd({'a = 10' 'return (a, 2*a)'})
     -  The same applies to `evalpy`.  If you need the old deprecated
        behaviour, it is still available as `python_cmd_string`.

 *  Improvements to sym() command: you can now pass the underlying "srepr"
    SymPy presentation to create an object.

 *  Better test system, easier to see "real" failures rather than expected
    (known) failures.

 *  Bug fixes: improvements to indexing, findsymbols and assumptions,
    isscalar/isvector failures on recent Octave, output formatting fixes.



octsympy 0.1.0 (2014-08-27)  Pacific Coffee
===========================================

Major Changes
-------------

 *  `sympref` replaces `octsympy_config`.  You can change the Python
    interpreter with `sympref python /path/to/python`.

 *  Unicode pretty-printed output by default.

     -  If you see `?` or other broken characters, try `sympref display
        ascii`.  Then help me get this working on your system!

     -  Or `sympref display flat` to disable pretty-printing.  (You can
        still use the `pretty` command selectively).

 *  Experimental Windows package with Python and SymPy included (look
    Ma, no deps!)  Uses [David Manthey's single file py.exe Python] [1].

 *  Lots of new commands:

          atan2           fliplr         isfinite          norm
          ccode           flipud         isna              not
          cond            fortran        jacobian          qr
          conj            ge             laplacian         real
          curl            gradient       le                repmat
          det             gt             lt                svd
          divergence      hessian        lu                toeplitz
          ezplot3         imag           matlabFunction    tril
          ezplot          inv            ne                triu

 *  Preliminary code generation (`ccode`, `fortran` and
    `matlabFunction` functions).  However, `matlabFunction` mostly
    depends on patches not yet in upstream SymPy.

 *  Inequality support.

 *  Assumptions now behave more like the Matlab Symbolic Math Toolbox.


Minor or internal changes
-------------------------

 *  Arithmetic operations on symfuns return symfuns instead of syms.

 *  More robust XML-like IPC transport.

 *  Move to proper Octave-style `%!` tests.

 *  Debugging IPC modes: `systmpfile` (same as `system` but outputs a
    temp file for inspection) and `sysoneline` (work-in-progress).



octsympy 0.0.4 (2014-05-26)  Lovever Coffee
===========================================

 *  Basic assumptions support.

 *  Matlab packages, only slow system() ipc for now.

 *  Improvements on passing variables between Octave and Python.



octsympy 0.0.3 (2014-04-29)  Wu Ke Song
=======================================

 *  Many new commands.

 *  `system()` communication no longer makes temporary files.  To
    change the communication mechanism, use "octsympy_config ipc
    system". See also "help octsympy_config".

 *  Added new tool "evalpy", this is fun and good for debugging...

 *  Bugs fixed, docs updated

 *  Start documenting differences with the Matlab Symbolic Math
    Toolbox.



octsympy 0.0.2 (2014-04-20)
===========================

 *  A preview release, test it out report issues.  Documentation is a
    mess, various things are work-in-progress.  But it works and I
    think has potential.
