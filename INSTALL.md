How to Install
==============

More to follow, but for now:

1. Run generate_functions.py.  This generates many of the .m files.
   (this will be done before making releases if we ever get that far).

2. Run Octave in the root directory (the one below @sym, @symfun etc).

3. Type "syms x"

4. (optional)  Put the root directory in your Octave path.

5. (optional)  Call run_unit_tests.
